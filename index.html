    While my creative portfolio is not extensive, I have included here a few past projects that I will, I hope,
    help to demonstrate my potential for excellence at ITP.

    <div class="item-detail">
      <p>"Geo-Poetry" is a computational literature project that I produced in collaboration with
      <a href="http://josh.thegeekmovement.com/" target="_blank">Josh Tanenbaum</a> while studying in University of California,
      Irvine's doctoral program in Informatics. "Geo-Poetry" dynamically generates crowdsourced poetic language
      and mood music that reflect the affects of people in the geographic area surrounding a user.</p>
      <!-- -->
      <p>"Geo-Poetry" collects recent Tweets that are geo-tagged near a user's location. First, it rearranges them into
      randomly-generated poetry using a predictive text algorithm. Second, it performs sentiment analysis on the
      Tweets, and feeds the average affect into Spotify's song recommendations engine. The result is a linguistic
      and sonic reflection of the social geography surrounding the user that responds to their situatedness in both
      space and time.</p>
      <!-- -->
      <p>You can try "Geo-Poetry" at <a class="main-link" href="https://jordan-rickman.net/geo-poetry">this link</a>.
      <span class="smaller">(Forgive the aesthetic crudeness of the interface, which was built as a quick demo
      of the algorithm - the envisioned mobile app was not completed due to time constraints.)</span>
      The code is available open-source at Github - <a href="https://github.com/UCI-TPL/geo-poetry-server" target="_blank">server</a>
      &bull; <a href="https://github.com/UCI-TPL/geo-poetry-demo" target="_blank">demo ui</a>. A brief paper discussing the project
      was included in the proceedings of the <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319482781" target="_blank">
      9th International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling</a>.</p>
