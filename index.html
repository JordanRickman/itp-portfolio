    <p class="section-intro">My background is primarily technical, so my creative portfolio is not extensive, but here are a couple past
    projects that are relevant.</p>

    <h3 class="item-header">Geo-Poetry</h3>
    <p>"Geo-Poetry" is a computational literature project that I produced in collaboration with
    <a href="http://josh.thegeekmovement.com/" target="_blank">Josh Tanenbaum</a> while studying in University of California,
    Irvine's doctoral program in Informatics. "Geo-Poetry" dynamically generates crowdsourced poetic language
    and mood music that reflect the affects of people in the geographic area surrounding a user.</p>
    <!-- -->
    <p>The software queries Twitter for recent Tweets that are geo-tagged near a user's location. First, it rearranges the Tweets into
    randomly-generated poetry using a predictive text algorithm. Second, it performs sentiment analysis on them,
    and feeds the average affect into Spotify's song recommendations engine. The result is a linguistic
    and sonic reflection of the social geography surrounding the user that responds to their situatedness in both
    space and time.</p>
    <!-- -->
    <p>You can try "Geo-Poetry" at <a class="main-link" href="https://jordan-rickman.net/geo-poetry">this link</a>.
    <span class="smaller">(Please forgive the aesthetically lacking interface, which was built as a quick demo
    of the algorithm - the envisioned mobile app was not completed due to time constraints.)</span>
    The code is available open-source at Github - <a href="https://github.com/UCI-TPL/geo-poetry-server" target="_blank">server</a>
    &bull; <a href="https://github.com/UCI-TPL/geo-poetry-demo" target="_blank">demo ui</a>. A brief paper discussing the project
    was included in the proceedings of the <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319482781" target="_blank">
    9th International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="item-header">Neoliberalism, Profit, and the New Panopticism</h3>
    <p>A term paper for one of my classes at UC Irvine, demonstrating critical engagement with contemporary social issues around
    technology, big data, and power. Read online
    <a class="main-link" href="https://www.academia.edu/25889478/NEOLIBERALISM_PROFIT_AND_THE_NEW_PANOPTICISM">here.</a></p>

    <h2 class="section-header">Incomplete Artwork</h2>
    <hr class="section-rule" />

    <p class="section-intro">While I am still new to interactive media, below are a few pieces that I am working on or may
    work on in the future, included in hopes of giving you a better idea of what interests me and how I think.</p>

    <h3 class="item-header">Live Footprint <span class="smaller">(working title)</span></h3>
    <p><em>Artist's Statement Draft:</em></p>
    <p>Art is, in some sense, a wasteful activity. Theorists have often characterized art, as distinguished from design or craft,
    as that which has no functional purpose, no utility.</p>
    <!-- -->
    <p>Ideals of sustainability necessarily entail an elimination of wasteful uses of energy and resources.
    Yet, art has also been described as being a fundamental human activity, without which society cannot function.
    As we grapple with global climate change and the Anthropocene, art occupies a place of contradiction that forces
    us to closely examine our priorities and the concepts of sustainability, utility, and waste.</p>
    <!-- -->
    <p>[Live Footprint] is an electronic installation that computes and displays its own carbon footprint in real time.
    Its footprint is not fixed at the time of its completion, but continues to grow in accordance to the energy costs
    of the venue in which it is installed and the energy expended by those who commute in order to view it.
    Its display is inescapably an underestimate, because so many factors in its ongoing footprint are impossible to
    completely enumerate or accurately measure. For instance, it does not take into account the energy footprint of
    any images that may be taken of it and circulated online or in print media, nor does it account for the footprint
    of the food that supplies its viewer's brain with the glucose metabolized in observing the installation.</p>
    <!-- -->
    <p>Thus, [Live Footprint] embodies several features of the question of art in a sustainable world.
    Its audience is complicit in its carbon footprint, the energy cost of displaying it rapidly accumulates
    above the cost of creating it, and the greater its social impact (as measured by the size of its audience),
    the greater its environmental impact. Like all human activities, the environmental impact of art is not an
    isolated function of the art practice itself, but rather of the networks and infrastructures in which it is
    socially embedded.</p>

    <h3 class="item-header">Reverse Recommendation Engine</h3>
    <p>Commenting on the ubiquity of personalized automatic recommendations and on the "social media bubble"
    problem by building a service that automatically recommends content you are <em>least</em> likely to enjoy.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">Miscellaneous</h2>
    <hr class="section-rule" />
    <p class="section-intro">I was encouraged to include even amateur, hobby-type creative work in order to help you learn a little more about me.
    So, linked here are a couple poems that I wrote.</p>
