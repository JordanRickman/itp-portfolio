  Imagine that you find yourself in a game.<br />
  You do not know the rules of this game.<br />
  You do not know the objective of this game.<br />
  </p>

  <p class="stanza">
  You do know that sometimes, things hurt you.<br />
  That sometimes, things heal you - make you happier, stronger.<br />
  </p>

  <p class="stanza">
  You also know that there are other players in this game.<br />
  That they too, can hurt<br />
  Or heal.<br />
  </p>

  <p class="stanza">
  But nobody knows the objective of the game.<br />
  Nobody knows the rules of the game.<br />
  Nobody knows the solution to the game.<br />
  </p>

  <p class="stanza">Play.</p>
